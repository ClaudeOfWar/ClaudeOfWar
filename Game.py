## Only issues found were as followed.
# The meteor sprite sheet for the falling blocks is in the code, but was not included as I could not figure out how to
# make the sprite resize itself for each of the differently sized meteors that are present in the game. I thought it was
# too important to have differently sized meteors, so I decided to leave the code commented out in the game, but not
# include it in the final product.
## Game details
# If you go 10 score higher than the win screen, the game will stop displaying the winner sign and let you continue to
# rack up a higher score for an infinite amount of time.
# Game has 3 levels of increasing difficulty and then infinite mode at level 3 difficulty
# Options that were added:
# 1. Levels of difficulty (Level 2 at score 25, Level 3 at score 50) Higher level = Greater meteor numbers
# 2. Scrolling level
# 3. Enemies (the meteors)
# 4. Health Bar
# 5. Timer (Counter counts up similar to a timer for each jump the player does)
